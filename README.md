# Pokemon Monster Battle

## Summary

- A simple battling version of the classic game Pok√©mon
- This project helped me practice my knowledge in OOP, time complexity analysis as well as data structures: Stacks, Queues, List ADTs, and Linked Lists :-D
- There are _40 different types_ of monsters, each with their own names and stats, and one type of a monster can evolve into another type of a monster when they level up
- Each monster will have 2 sets of stats: simple and complex (for different player difficulties)

## Gane Features:

- **Monster Class:** Flamikin, Infernoth, Leviatitan, etc.
- **Monster Stats:** Attack, defense, hp, speed, etc.
- **Monster Teams:** Monsters will be put into teams and go to the battle field! Teams will join in tournaments until the last one survives!
- **Monster Battles:** Battling is done between two teams in a turn based manner, where every "turn" includes an action from both teams. In a battle, each team selects one monster to be currently out on the field, while the rest of each team waits to help out.
